## CLI documentation rules

- Before writing or editing any CLI command docs, run command help first:
  - `zeroeval --help`
  - `zeroeval <command> --help`
  - `zeroeval <command> <subcommand> --help`
- Never assume options from memory.
- If documenting exact options, verify with `--help` in the current environment.
- Prefer examples that include `--output json` when automation or agents are expected.
