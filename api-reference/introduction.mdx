## About this section

This docs pass is focused on **Python SDK datasets and evals**.

If you are implementing with the SDK, start here:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="SDK installation" icon="download" href="/python-sdk/installation">
    Install and initialize the Python SDK.
  </Card>
  <Card title="SDK quickstart" icon="rocket" href="/python-sdk/quickstart">
    Run your first dataset + eval workflow end-to-end.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Platform authentication model

The platform uses bearer token authentication. In SDK workflows, this is configured via:

```bash
export ZEROEVAL_API_KEY="sk_ze_..."
```

Or:

```python
import zeroeval as ze
ze.init(api_key="sk_ze_...")
```

<Info>
  A full HTTP API endpoint reference can be added in a dedicated future pass. This section currently serves as platform context while SDK docs are the primary path.
